# 🌱 FairTradeCert: Blockchain-Based Fair Trade Certification

This project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized system for fair trade certification. It automates payments to farmers based on verified sustainable practices, ensuring transparency, trust, and fair compensation for eco-friendly agricultural practices.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Certify Sustainable Practices**: Farmers submit evidence of sustainable practices, verified by auditors.
- 💸 **Automated Payments**: Smart contracts automate payments to farmers upon certification approval.
- 📜 **Immutable Records**: Store certification details and payment history on the blockchain.
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Buyers and consumers can verify the sustainability of products.
- 🛡️ **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanisms to handle disputes between farmers, auditors, and buyers.
- 📊 **Reputation System**: Tracks farmer and auditor reliability for trust-building.
- ⚖️ **Governance**: Voting system for updating certification standards.

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Farmers**  
- Submit evidence (e.g., hash of documents proving sustainable practices) to the certification contract.  
- Upon approval by auditors, receive automated payments in STX or stablecoins.  

**For Auditors**  
- Review submitted evidence and approve or reject certifications.  
- Earn rewards for accurate verifications, tracked via the reputation system.  

**For Buyers/Consumers**  
- Verify product certifications using a unique product ID.  
- Access immutable records of farmer certifications and payment history.  

**For Governance**  
- Stakeholders (farmers, auditors, buyers) vote on updates to certification standards.  

## 📂 Smart Contracts

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to manage the fair trade certification process:

- **Data**:
  - `farmers`: Map storing farmer data (principal, name, location, farm size).

### 2. CertificationSubmission.clar
- **Purpose**: Handles submission of sustainable practice evidence.
- **Functions**:
  - `submit-evidence`: Farmers submit a hash of evidence (e.g., organic farming docs).
  - `get-submission-details`: Retrieves submission details by ID.
- **Data**:

### 4. CertificationVerification.clar
- **Purpose**: Manages the verification process by auditors.
- **Functions**:
  - `verify-submission`: Auditors approve or reject a submission.
  - `get-verification-status`: Retrieves the status of a submission (pending, approved, rejected).
- **Data**:
  - `verifications`: Map storing verification results (submission ID, auditor principal, status, timestamp).

### 5. PaymentAutomation.clar
- **Purpose**: Automates payments to farmers upon certification approval.
- **Functions**:
  - `process-payment`: Transfers funds to farmers when certification is approved.
  - `get-payment-history`: Retrieves payment history for a farmer.
- **Data**:
  - `payments`: Map storing payment records (farmer principal, amount, timestamp).

### 6. ProductTracking.clar
- **Purpose**: Tracks certified products for consumer transparency.
- **Functions**:
  - `register-product`: Links a product to a certified farmer.
  - `verify-product`: Allows consumers to verify product certification.
- **Data**:
  - `products`: Map storing product data (product ID, farmer principal, certification ID).

### 7. DisputeResolution.clar
- **Purpose**: Handles disputes between farmers, auditors, and buyers.
- **Functions**:
  - `raise-dispute`: Initiates a dispute with details (e.g., submission ID, reason).
  - `resolve-dispute`: Auditors or admins resolve disputes.
  - `get-dispute-details`: Retrieves dispute details.
- **Data**:
  - `disputes`: Map storing dispute data (dispute ID, submission ID, parties, status).

### 8. Governance.clar
- **Purpose**: Manages voting for certification standard updates.
- **Functions**:
  - `propose-standard`: Proposes a new certification standard.
  - `vote-on-standard`: Stakeholders vote on proposals.
  - `finalize-proposal`: Implements approved standards.
- **Data**:
  - `proposals`: Map storing proposal data (proposal ID, description, votes, status).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the 8 Clarity contracts on the Stacks blockchain.
2. **Register Farmers and Auditors**: Use `FarmerRegistry` and `AuditorRegistry` to onboard participants.
3. **Submit Evidence**: Farmers submit evidence via `CertificationSubmission`.
4. **Verify Certifications**: Auditors verify submissions using `CertificationVerification`.
5. **Automate Payments**: Approved certifications trigger payments via `PaymentAutomation`.
6. **Track Products**: Register and verify products with `ProductTracking`.
7. **Handle Disputes**: Use `DisputeResolution` for conflict resolution.
8. **Update Standards**: Propose and vote on new standards with `Governance`.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Only registered farmers can submit evidence, and only auditors can verify.
- **Immutable Records**: All submissions, verifications, and payments are stored on-chain.
- **Reputation System**: Prevents malicious auditors via reputation tracking.
- **Dispute Mechanism**: Ensures fairness in case of disagreements.

## 🌟 Benefits

- **Farmers**: Receive fair compensation for sustainable practices.
- **Auditors**: Earn rewards for accurate verifications.
- **Consumers**: Gain trust in product sustainability through transparent records.
- **Environment**: Promotes eco-friendly farming practices globally.
